PERPLEXITY RESEARCH PROMPT: Mobile-First Video Clip Review Interface Optimization

---

CONTEXT: I'm building a mobile-first web app for reviewing AI-generated video clips. The primary use case is reviewing clips on a phone while away from my desk. The app is built with React + Tailwind CSS + Vite, deployed on Vercel.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
- Sticky header with action buttons
- Clip cards with play button, metadata, approve/reject buttons
- Horizontal scrolling preset selector (5 options: YT Shorts, TikTok, LinkedIn, Podcast, Off)
- Audio playback via HTML5 Audio element
- Touch targets set to 44-48px minimum
- Using `touch-manipulation` CSS for faster tap response
- Safe area padding for iPhone notch
- Clips show first on mobile (above transcript)

SPECIFIC FEATURES TO RESEARCH:

1. AUDIO PLAYBACK ON MOBILE
Current: Using `new Audio(url)` and `audio.play()` for clip previews
Questions:
- What are the iOS Safari restrictions on audio autoplay in 2024-2025?
- Do I need user gesture requirements for each audio play?
- Should I use a single persistent audio element vs creating new ones per clip?
- What's the best practice for audio state management in React on mobile?
- Are there issues with audio playback when the phone is locked or app is backgrounded?

2. TOUCH TARGET SIZING
Current: 44px minimum per Apple HIG, but using 48px for primary actions
Questions:
- What does recent UX research say about optimal touch target sizes for 2024?
- Is 44px still the gold standard or have recommendations changed?
- What spacing should exist between adjacent touch targets?
- Any differences between iOS and Android recommendations?

3. HORIZONTAL SCROLLING UI PATTERNS
Current: Edit presets (5 buttons) in a horizontal scroll container
Questions:
- What are best practices for horizontal scroll indicators on mobile?
- Should I add visual affordances (gradient fade, arrows, dots)?
- Are there accessibility concerns with horizontal scrolling?
- What's the best way to handle horizontal scroll with swipe gestures?

4. APPROVE/REJECT SWIPE GESTURES
Not implemented yet, but considering:
Questions:
- What libraries work best for swipe-to-action in React (react-swipeable, @use-gesture/react, framer-motion)?
- What are the UX patterns for swipe-to-approve/reject (like Tinder, email apps)?
- Should swipe reveal buttons or immediately take action?
- What haptic feedback patterns are recommended for swipe actions?
- Any accessibility concerns with swipe-only interfaces?

5. PULL-TO-REFRESH vs MANUAL REFRESH
Current: Using `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` to prevent pull-to-refresh
Questions:
- When is pull-to-refresh appropriate vs a refresh button?
- What are the best React libraries for custom pull-to-refresh?
- How to handle loading states during refresh on mobile?

6. MOBILE VIDEO/AUDIO SCRUBBING
Future feature: Timeline scrubber for clip boundaries
Questions:
- What are best practices for audio/video scrubbing on mobile?
- How to make a scrubber touch-friendly (fat thumb problem)?
- Should I use native range input or custom implementation?
- Any libraries recommended for waveform visualization on mobile (WaveSurfer.js mobile performance)?

7. OFFLINE SUPPORT / PWA
Current: Basic PWA meta tags added
Questions:
- Is it worth implementing service workers for offline clip review?
- How to handle audio caching in a PWA?
- What's the state of PWA support on iOS Safari in 2024-2025?
- Any gotchas with Vercel and PWA deployments?

8. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
Current: Standard React rendering
Questions:
- What are the main performance bottlenecks for audio-heavy mobile web apps?
- Should I virtualize a list of 10-20 clips or is that overkill?
- Best practices for preventing janky scrolling with dynamic content?
- How to optimize for low-end Android devices?

9. HAPTIC FEEDBACK
Not implemented
Questions:
- How to implement haptic feedback in web apps (Vibration API)?
- What actions should trigger haptics (button taps, swipe completion)?
- iOS vs Android differences in web haptic support?
- Any UX guidelines on when haptics enhance vs annoy users?

10. GESTURE CONFLICTS
Concern: Swipe gestures might conflict with browser navigation
Questions:
- How to prevent horizontal swipe from triggering browser back/forward?
- Best practices for distinguishing app gestures from system gestures?
- Edge swipe safe zones on iOS and Android?

SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES TO RESEARCH:
- react-swipeable vs @use-gesture/react vs framer-motion for gestures
- Howler.js vs native Audio API for mobile audio
- WaveSurfer.js performance on mobile devices
- Workbox for PWA service workers with Vite

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES TO REFERENCE:
- Spotify mobile web player (audio handling)
- Tinder (swipe gestures)
- Gmail mobile (swipe-to-archive)
- Instagram (stories tap/swipe navigation)
- TikTok web (vertical scroll video)

OUTPUT REQUESTED:
1. For each topic, provide current best practices with citations to recent (2024-2025) sources
2. Identify any gotchas or common mistakes developers make
3. Recommend specific libraries or approaches with pros/cons
4. Note any iOS Safari-specific issues (this is the primary target device)
5. Prioritize recommendations by impact (what will make the biggest difference in user experience)

The app will be used by one person (me) on an iPhone, primarily for quickly reviewing and approving/rejecting AI-suggested video clips while away from my computer. Speed and ease of one-handed use are the top priorities.
